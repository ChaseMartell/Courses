# Courses

During this project, we worked with linked lists and creating classes containing different data elements. One of the most important lessons I got out of it was an increase in my knowledge of working with recursion. We had a lot of functions without our course list file that utilized helper functions to perform the recursion. It taught me good practices when it comes to working with linked lists too, since it was my first exposure to them.
